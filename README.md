# Recreational Programming Stuff

Collection of all programs that I have written since Jan 2023
I primarily use this as a means to store my works as backup but I try make an effort to clean this repo and make it more presentable.

## Contents of this repo

snake-ladder(Jan 2024): I made this in one day when I got an idea to make a snake and ladder game but all I accomplished was to create a rudimentery backend in c that instantly plays the game for you.

booltable(Aug 2023 -): This was created over a span of a few months in mid 2023. It takes in a boolean expression in 2,3 or 4 variables as input and prints out it's Truth Table. I was taking Discrete Mathematics in university at that time and this program made it absolutely trivial for me to verify my truth tables and check up valid rules of inferences. 
However I do not considier this complete as I am yet to generalise my code to accept an boolean expression with an arbitary number variables.

haskellstuff(Oct 2023 - ): haskell programs I write while learning haskell.
I once tried making a gtk logout manager in haskell by following a youtube tutorial but I quickly gave up after seeing how terrible support is for Haskell devlopment is in my Linux distro.

algorithms(Nov 2023 -): Implementing some algorithms I learnt in algorithms class in uni.

c_programs(Jan 2023 -): The directory which used to store all my c programs. This and it's sub directory big_c_programs are one of the oldest directories in this repo, being created in early 2023, back when I still used Windows.

base_convertor(Dec 2022 - July 2023): This is another old directory that I copied over from Windows, hence the .exe files. I originally made it for a university assignment to convert integers from decimal to binary. In June 2023 I made baseco.c that could convert representation of any floating point number from decimal to base-n.

Gaussian-Elimination(Jan 2024): I have an urge to implement random mathematical techniques in C.
